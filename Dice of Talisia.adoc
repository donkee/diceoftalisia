Basics
------
Each class has a set of class-specific dice. Each set can vary in number and type of dice as well as symbols/numbers on the dice themselves. When you roll you can add up your attack points and/or special ability points to use those. You can do basic attacks or use your ability cards.

At the beginning of the game you randomly pick a number of monster cards and a single boss card. Shuffle the monsters and put the boss on the bottom. Flip each monster and fight it. Beat the boss to win. The group works together.
